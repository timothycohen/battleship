### styling:
- [ ] check on multiple screen sizes
- [ ] represent ships across multiple squares instead of individual spaces
- [ ] hovering over suitable spots on the setup board should highlight them (can modify the placeShip function to return a bool if and run a mousemove listener through a debounce)

### testing:
- [ ] placeShipsRandomly is not a pure function. need to mock for timeout/thrown error

### other:
- [ ] consolidate code. the gameboard and selection menus for example can be consolidated into components for reuse

### Keywords used in code:
- DEVTOOL
- NOTIMPLEMENTED
- BUG
