### NOTIMPLEMENTED:
- [ ] represent ships across multiple squares instead of individual spaces
- [ ] hovering over suitable spots on the setup board should highlight them (can modify the placeShip function to return a bool and run a mousemove listener through a debounce)
- [ ] consolidate code. the gameboard and selection menus for example can be consolidated into components for reuse
- [ ] make the AI smarter by checking which direction multiple hits are in
- [ ] mock the nonpure placeShipsRandomly function
